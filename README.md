# voterturnout_abortionclinics


This is a Bivariate map that visualizes percent voter turnout by county in Florida and locations of all abortion clinics in Florida. The clinics are divided into three categories; Planned Parenthood clinics, All Women's Center clinics, and all other clinics. Planned Parenthood is one of the largest abortion providers in the country, and All Women's Center was the next most common name that I saw in the state of Florida. The rest of the clinics are run by hospitals, independent doctors, and other nonprofit/pro bono organizations.
